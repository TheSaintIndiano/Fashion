# Fashion

Sportswear or activewear is clothing, including footwear, worn for sport or physical exercise. Sport-specific clothing is worn for most sports and physical exercise, for practical, comfort or safety reasons.
Typical sport-specific garments include shorts, tracksuits, T-shirts, tennis shirts and polo shirts.
Specialized garments include swimsuits (for swimming), wetsuits (for diving or surfing), ski suits (for skiing) and leotards (for gymnastics).

Sports footwear include trainers, football boots, riding boots, and ice skates. Sportswear also includes some underwear, such as the jockstrap and sports bra.

Sportswear is also at times worn as casual fashion clothing.
